# Walmart Customer Complaint Analyzer

Placeholder here so that I can build out a NLP system to automate the customer complaints generated monthly in Walmart's system. 

![Example of Word Cloud](ComplaintNLPExample.JPG)

## To Do
- Fix for new column headers/data structure out of UBXLink
- Create generic UI to make it more accessible


## Usage

Pull information out of UBXLink in CSV format and add to the same folder as "contacts.csv", then run complaintNLP.py. Currently it will build out a word cloud based on the Verbatim of the customer complaints.

## Contributing
4/12/22 - This script is currently deprecated due to the conversion of UBXLink to a new data structure. calls = 'Call Notes' now, but this has not been adjusted and tested yet.
